aaa=2.85u width

Î»=0.3

minimum size transistor dimensions 
(W = 1.5um and L =
0.6um)

The same pin names and same connections.
Same transistors in same size as those in the schematic.

height from bottom of the GND
rail to top of the VDD rail) is 35um.


How does 'width' indicate pactive polygon
and 'length' indicate poly polygon?
Overlap of poly and pactive is region being described
